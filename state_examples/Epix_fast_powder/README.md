CSPAD Example
=============

This is a great example for auto powder calibration. The settings are all set up in a
way that it can be used as is, by going to "Run" -> "Calibration" -> "Fast Powder".
All detector parameters are refinable, and the lattice parameter is refinable as well.

You can also improve the baseline of the polar powder pattern if you go to
"Edit" -> "Intensity Corrections" and enable "Apply Pixel Solid Angle Correction".
However, this takes some time to compute and the GUI will run slower.
