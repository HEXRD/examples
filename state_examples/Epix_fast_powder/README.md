EpixQuad Example
================

This is a great example for auto powder calibration. The settings are all set up in a
way that it can be used as is, by going to "Run" -> "Calibration" -> "Fast Powder".
All detector parameters are refinable.

You can also improve the baseline of the polar powder pattern if you go to
"Edit" -> "Intensity Corrections" and enable "Apply Pixel Solid Angle Correction".
However, this takes some time to compute and the GUI will run slower.
