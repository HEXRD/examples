Dexelas HEDM
============

The Dexelas HEDM dataset contins 3 grains of ruby. This is a great example for
performing the HEDM workflow.

Due to some limitations in saving frame caches within state files (that will
hopefully soon be fixed), the data files are not saved in the state, and you
must load them in manually after opening the state file.

Afterwards, proceed to "Run" -> "HEDM" -> "Indexing" to begin!
