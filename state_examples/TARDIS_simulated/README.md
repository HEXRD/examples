TARDIS Simulated
================

'tardis_simulated_powder_and_laue.h5' contains powder lines and Laue spots.
It is pretty far from being properly calibrated, and can therefore be a
good example of a "hand-picked" calibration dataset.

'tardis_simulated_structureless_calibration.h5' is an example of performing
structureless calibration. If you navigate to `Run->Calibration->Structureless`,
you will see a `Previous` option where previous picks were stored. These can
be used to perform basic structureless calibration.
