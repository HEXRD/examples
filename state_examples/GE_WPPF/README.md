GE WPPF
=======

This is a model example of using WPPF to perform a Rietveld analysis on Ceria.

Once you open the state file, adjust the brightness and contrast for viewing,
then proceed to the polar view, and click "Run" -> "WPPF" to get started.

Typically, parameters would be refined in this order:

1. Scaling
2. Lattice parameter
3. U, V, W
4. X (Lorentzian Scherrer Broadening), Y (Microstrain)
5. U, V, W, X, Y
6. DW factors
7. All of the above
