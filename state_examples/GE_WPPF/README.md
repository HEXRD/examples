GE WPPF
=======

This is a model example of using WPPF to perform a Rietveld analysis on Ceria.

Once you open the state file, adjust the brightness and contrast for viewing,
then proceed to the polar view, and click "Run" -> "WPPF" to get started.

Typically, parameters would be refined in this order:

1. Scaling
2. Lattice parameter
3. U, V, W
4. X, Y
5. U, V, W, X, Y
6. DW factors
7. All of the above

*NOTE: due to an issue we will hopefully soon fix, if you are picking a spline
background and you zoom in, after you zoom and toggle off the zoom setting,
you should press "right-click" to delete the extra points that were accidentally
added when zooming*
